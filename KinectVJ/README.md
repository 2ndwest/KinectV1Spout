## KinectNDI
This is a simple project for my personal VJing needs.
It takes input from a Microsoft Kinect V1, removes the background, and streams it over NDI.
It uses FFMPEG to interface with NDI as well.

There are several dependencies:
- FFMPEG with NDI support (https://framagit.org/tytan652/ffmpeg-ndi-patch)
- The Kinect V1.8 SDK
- .NET 4.x
