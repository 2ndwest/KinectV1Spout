    <description>CppSharp is a tool and set of libraries which allows programmers to use C/C++ libraries with high-level programming languages (such as C#).

It is a tool that takes C/C++ header and library files and generates the necessary glue to surface the native API as a managed API. Such an API can be used to consume an existing native library in your high-level code or add scripting support to a native codebase.

The supported target languages at present are C# and C++/CLI.

It can also be used as a library to parse native code into a syntax tree with a rich declaration and type information model.

The NuGet version is Windows 64-bit only for the time being. Binary 32-bit releases for Windows can be found at https://github.com/mono/CppSharp/releases .</description>
